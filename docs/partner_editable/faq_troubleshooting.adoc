== Troubleshooting

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (Review the log files in `/var/log/atl.log` and `/var/log/cfn-init.log`.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

IMPORTANT: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Ensure that you delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation].
